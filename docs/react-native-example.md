# React Native Example
Uploading files from React Native to Meteor server using this package can get quite tricky because React Native FileReader.readAsBinaryString and FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer aren't implemented yet.

MGS Creativa created a [demo repository](https://github.com/mgscreativa/React-Native-Upload-Files-to-Meteor-Server) to aid anyone that need to upload files from React Native app to Meteor. The demo repo consist of a Meteor server and a React Native app created with Expo, detailed instructions on how to setup the project are detailed there.
